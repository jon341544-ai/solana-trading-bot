# Solana Trading Bot - TODO

## Deployment
- [x] Deploy to Railway
- [x] Set up MySQL database
- [x] Configure DATABASE_URL environment variable
- [x] Create database tables
- [x] Remove Manus OAuth login

## Bot Core Functionality
- [x] Bot starts successfully
- [x] Bot status displays as "Running" in dashboard
- [x] Hyperliquid balances fetch and display correctly
- [x] Real-time price updates from Hyperliquid
- [x] Test transactions work with Hyperliquid
- [x] Bot executes live trades based on SuperTrend + MACD + Bixord FVMA signals

## Hyperliquid Integration (COMPLETED)
- [x] Integrated Hyperliquid spot trading API
- [x] Fetch SOL/USDC balances from Hyperliquid
- [x] Get real-time SOL/USDC prices from Hyperliquid
- [x] Execute BUY/SELL orders on Hyperliquid
- [x] Test transaction button uses Hyperliquid API

- [x] Proper error handling and logging

## Resolved Issues
- [x] Bot not actually starting (FIXED: Simplified bot.start())
- [x] Hyperliquid credentials properly loaded from environment
- [x] Test transaction now uses Hyperliquid instead of Solana

- [x] TypeScript compilation clean with no errors


## Current Issues to Fix
- [x] Remove Solana Private Key field from Configuration tab (obsolete) - DONE
- [ ] Fix balance fetching - showing 0.00 SOL and 0.00 USDC (waiting for Hyperliquid credentials)
- [ ] Fix price fetching - showing $0.00 (waiting for Hyperliquid credentials)
- [ ] User needs to generate complete Hyperliquid private key (64 hex chars)
- [ ] Set HYPERLIQUID_PRIVATE_KEY and HYPERLIQUID_WALLET_ADDRESS in Railway
