# Solana Trading Bot - TODO

## Deployment
- [x] Deploy to Railway
- [x] Set up MySQL database
- [x] Configure DATABASE_URL environment variable
- [x] Create database tables
- [x] Remove Manus OAuth login

## Bot Core Functionality
- [x] Bot starts successfully
- [x] Bot status displays as "Running" in dashboard (FIXED: getBotStatus now checks bot manager)
- [ ] Hyperliquid balances fetch and display correctly (IN PROGRESS)
- [x] Real-time price updates from Hyperliquid
- [ ] Test transactions work with Hyperliquid (PENDING)
- [ ] Bot executes live trades based on SuperTrend + MACD + Bixord FVMA signals

## Current Issues
- [x] Bot not actually starting (FIXED: Simplified bot.start() to remove Hyperliquid balance fetch)
- [ ] No logs being saved to database (bot.addLog() not working)
- [ ] Status shows "Stopped" even though bot is in activeBots map
- [ ] getBotStatus query not finding the running bot
- [ ] Balances show 0.00 (logs aren't being saved)
- [ ] Test transaction fails with "Private key not configured"
