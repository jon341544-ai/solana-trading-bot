# Solana Trading Bot - TODO

## Deployment
- [x] Deploy to Railway
- [x] Set up MySQL database
- [x] Configure DATABASE_URL environment variable
- [x] Create database tables
- [x] Remove Manus OAuth login

## Bot Core Functionality
- [x] Bot starts successfully
- [x] Bot status displays as "Running" in dashboard (FIXED: getBotStatus now checks bot manager)
- [ ] Hyperliquid balances fetch and display correctly (IN PROGRESS)
- [x] Real-time price updates from Hyperliquid
- [ ] Test transactions work with Hyperliquid (PENDING)
- [ ] Bot executes live trades based on SuperTrend + MACD + Bixord FVMA signals

## Current Issues
- [x] Dashboard doesn't refresh bot status after start (FIXED: getBotStatus now checks bot manager first)
- [x] Hyperliquid credentials not being saved in config (FIXED: startBot auto-creates config)
- [ ] Balance fetching not working (shows 0.00) (IN PROGRESS: Added debug logging)
- [ ] Test transaction fails with "Private key not configured" (PENDING)
